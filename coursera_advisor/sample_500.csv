Two-Phase Pipe Hydraulics and Pipe Sizing,Physical Science And Engineering,,"Process Engineering, Engineering Calculations, Hydraulics, Oil and Gas, Mathematical Modeling, Petroleum Industry, Engineering Analysis, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering","This particular course entitled “Two-Phase Pipe Hydraulics & Pipe Sizing” under the specialization entitled “Design of Industrial Piping Systems”  is mainly aimed at predicting the two-phase total static pressure drop in a given piping system when both gas and liquid flow through it concurrently.  Pressure drops including heat transfer coefficients depend on two-phase flow regimes since two-phase patterns and local internal structure are different for different flow regimes. Therefore, the formation of various two-phase flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes is to be known to the designer, and at the same time, the influence of bend on the formation of two-phase flow regimes in upstream and downstream pipes should also be known. The presence of a bend is inevitable in the piping systems of a plant and its presence restricts the formation of certain two-phase flow regimes commonly found in individual horizontal and vertical pipes for the given flow rates of gas and liquid and pipe diameter. Surprisingly, bend allows the formation of slug flow regimes in both horizontal and vertical pipe runs of a piping system. This is a nerve-wracking issue for the designer since the slug flow regime harms the piping system and in some situations, the slug flow regime becomes the main cause of the failure of the piping system. Therefore, the designer should be cautious during the design of two-phase piping systems and avoid the slug flow regime formation at any cost while designing the two-phase piping system.Looking into the severity of two-phase flow on the piping system integrity, the present course focuses on the formation of two-phase flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes and their identification based on gas and liquid flow rates using two-phase flow pattern maps. Next, the course focuses on the effect of bends on two-phase flow regime formation in both upstream and downstream pipelines as piping systems are made of connecting straight pipe runs using bends. From this discussion, the learner gets a fair idea about the formation of a certain type of two-phase flow regime, when it happens, and why it happens. Next, the two-phase terminologies are covered as these are frequently used in two-phase piping system design. The relationship among them is equally important in the design and hence, covered in the present course. These terminologies and their relations assist the learner in understanding, analyzing, and applying the various two-phase models to design the two-phase piping system.
Certain idealizations are to be made while dealing with the gas and liquid two-phase flow through the pipe.  Single-phase is well-established, not two-phase. To take advantage of suggested single-phase correlations by the investigators, the two-phase models are developed by assuming liquid alone flows through the pipe with the two-phase mixture flow rate. This assumption introduces the error as it does not appeal the reality. Therefore, while developing the models a term called two-phase multiplier is introduced and made as a multiplication factor to the single-phase pressure drop, to predict the two-phase frictional pressure drop within the acceptable range.  The developed models are popularly known as the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model,  Separated Flow Model, and Drift Flux Model, and the present course is focused on these models. Various two-phase multipliers, methods, techniques, and void fraction correlations are covered in detail in this course. Finally, in this course, practical two-phase problems are considered to demonstrate the prediction of total static pressure drop which is a sum of two-phase frictional, accelerational, and gravitational pressure drops using the two-phase well-known models, methods, techniques, two-phase multipliers, and void fraction correlations and how closely they predict so that learner cannot face any hiccup while he/she designing the two-phase piping systems including single path and multi-path piping systems known as piping networks."

General Chemistry: Concept Development and Application,Physical Science And Engineering,,"Physics, Biochemistry, Experimentation, Chemistry, Scientific Methods, Laboratory Research","This course will cover the topics of a full year, two semester General Chemistry course.  We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project.The fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.

So why use this approach? 

One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. 

A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  

A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.

Unravelling solutions for Future Food problems,Health,,"Environmental Science, Psychology, Food and Beverage, Sustainable Development, Biotechnology, Nutrition and Diet, Economics, Health Disparities, Socioeconomics","Our society depends on the availability of food and accessibility to it. According to the United Nations nearly 800 million people are hungry and on the other hand, over 650 million people are obese.  While many people in developing countries experience food shortage, in industrialized countries people are throwing food away.These facts show how paradoxical and complex the world’s food problem is.  
 
ln this course, more than 10 food researchers from Utrecht University will address the main issues of food consumption. They will handle two interrelated themes; Food shortage and Healthy choices. You will learn to identify the key ingredients of the world’s food challenges and to think about the solutions for enabling changes in the current food system.

We will also look at the possible sustainable solutions for several accut issues: the demands of the growing human population, the role of nutrition, and the need to understand food choices in order to have healthier diet and consider the possibilities of alternative foods.

We invite you to join us on an interdisciplinary journey through the world food problems. You will gain new knowledge and insights that will help you form your own opinion on these subjects and make better choices in your food consumption. 
We hope you will enjoy the course!

The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as ""lifeline infrastructure"". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated ""lifeline"" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.  The Department of Energy, though, recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2.

"Programming Languages, Part B",Computer Science,,"Ruby (Programming Language), Computer Programming, Other Programming Languages, Programming Principles, Software Design, Software Architecture, Debugging, Data Structures, Functional Design","[As described below, this is Part B of a 3-part course.  Participants should complete Part A first -- Part B ""dives right in"" and refers often to material from Part A.]This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.

It assumes you have completed the prior courses on ""Attitude Control with Momentum Exchange Devices"" and ""Analytical Mechanics for Spacecraft Dynamics"".  This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry.First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.

Next, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time.

Introduction to Linear Algebra,Math And Logic,,"Mathematical Theory & Analysis, Applied Mathematics, Algebra, Linear Algebra, Arithmetic, General Mathematics, Probability, Mathematics and Mathematical Modeling, Markov Model, Advanced Mathematics, Geometry, Engineering Analysis, Mathematical Modeling, Statistical Methods","Linear algebra and calculus are the two most important foundational pillars on which modern mathematics is built. They are studied by almost all mathematics students at university, though typically labelled as different subjects and taught in parallel. Over time, students discover that linear algebra and calculus are inseparable (but not identical) twins that interlock to form the backbone of almost all applications of mathematics to physical and biological sciences, engineering and computer science. It is recommended that participants in the MOOC Introduction to Linear Algebra have already taken, or take in parallel, the MOOC Introduction to Calculus.All of our modern technical and electronic systems, such as the internet and search engines, on which we rely and tend to take for granted in our daily lives, work because of methods and techniques adapted from classical linear algebra. The key ideas involve vector and matrix arithmetic as well as clever methods for working around or overcoming difficulties, a form of obstacle avoidance, articulated in this course as the Conjugation Principle.

This course emphasises geometric intuition, gradually introducing abstraction and algebraic and symbolic manipulation, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics. 

Students taking Introduction to Linear Algebra will:

•  gain familiarity with the arithmetic of geometric vectors, which may be thought of as directed line segments that can move about freely in space, and can be combined in different ways, using vector addition, scalar multiplication and two types of multiplication, the dot and cross product, related to projections and orthogonality (first week),
•  develop fluency with lines and planes in space, represented by vector and Cartesian equations, and learn how to solve systems of equations, using the method of Gaussian elimination and introduction of parameters, using fields of real numbers and modular arithmetic with respect to a prime number (second week),
•  be introduced to and gain familiarity with matrix arithmetic, matrix inverses, the role of elementary matrices and their relationships with matrix inversion and systems of equations, calculations and theory involving determinants (third week),
•  be introduced to the theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, how they are found or approximated, and their role in diagonalisation of matrices (fourth week),
•  see applications to simple Markov processes and stochastic matrices, and an introduction to linear transformations, illustrated using dilation, rotation and reflection matrices (fourth week),
•  see a brief introduction to the arithmetic of complex numbers and discussion of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (fourth week)."

Looking at examples of Concept Clusters, we can see that Korean philosophy is deeply rooted in the Korean language and has formed a philosophical perspective that is different not only from the West but also from neighboring countries such as China and Japan. In this course, we also dealt with the early Korean Neo-Confucianism's gaze on “cheon”, referring to “heaven” as an example that clearly demonstrates the characteristics of Korean philosophy before it was given the name “philosophy.” Even before and after the advent of Neo-Confucianism, the search for ultimate existence – expressed in various terms – was constantly pursued. The gaze on “heaven” is an important feature of Korean philosophy."

Through short video lectures, practitioner interviews and a wide range of interactive activities, learners will be immersed in the world of public health practice.Designed for those new to the discipline, over three modules (intended for three weeks of learning), learners will become familiar with the scope, theory and implementation of behaviour change in the context of public health practice. The course begins by challenging learners about their preconceptions about healthy and unhealthy behaviour - seeking to contextualise these ideas within the broader public health approach (the first course of this specialisation). The course thereafter swiftly covers the origins of risk communication and behaviour change through the lens of health psychology and classical economics, before introducing ideas of bounded rationality and the genesis of behavioural insights and so-called Nudges. By the end of the course, learners will be fluent with their use of the Behaviour Change Wheel methodology of intervention development and the application of the COM-B framework to a range of target behaviours and behavioural barriers.

The subsequent courses of this specialisation will cover health protection before moving into the final (degree learner) course which where learners will focus on developing the core professional skillset that defines public health practitioners - whether in service or academia."

What kind of pastoral leadership is needed to bring God’s vision for your church to fruition?In this second course in the Duke Divinity+ Church Administration Specialization series, you will learn how to approach strategic management theologically as strategic stewardship for your church. Secular organizations widely use strategic management (including strategic planning) to define their future strategic direction and how to achieve it. In contrast, what we’re calling strategic stewardship for churches seeks to reappropriate strategic management by discerning God’s direction for the church and pursuing God-centered ways of realizing it.
 
This course will focus on select key elements of strategic management: vision (Week 1), core values and culture (Week 2), goals and objectives (Week 3), and metrics (Week 4). We will first explore how each key element functions as a useful management tool. Then, we will reappropriate the key element for theological ends of our church stewardship to God; hence, our terminology of strategic stewardship. Moreover, we will unpack what pastoral leadership for strategic stewardship should entail. Lastly, we will provide exemplar stories from Duke Divinity School alums, who will share how they each approached and implemented a key element in their church setting.

Understanding and Managing the Stresses of Police Work,Health,,"Social Skills, Empowerment, Resilience, Active Listening, Physiology, Emotional Intelligence, Stress Management, Mindfulness, Biology, Personal Development, De-escalation Techniques, Communication Strategies","Policing has always been psychological challenging.  On any given shift police officers may encounter a range of psychological challenges including domestic violence, interacting with people experiencing mental health issues, violent crime, even attending the aftermath of horrible accidents.  The long exhausting shifts can also result in stressful person interactions within one’s personal life.  The presence of COVID and political issues related to instances of over-policing have increased these stresses even more.  This course has two goals.  First, we want to inform officers how their stress system works and why they sometimes feel as they do.  With this as a foundation we then describe some strategies officers can use to manage this system, giving themselves much needed breaks from the stress response and overall empowering them with a greater sense of control over how their bodies react to stress."

Local Economic Development,Social Sciences,,"Economic Development, New Business Development, Competitive Analysis, Socioeconomics, Innovation, Community Development, Business Economics, Entrepreneurship, Sustainable Development, Policy Development, Governance, Project Design, International Relations","Welcome to this MOOC on Local Economic Development (LED). Local economic development refers to the processes by which local governments, businesses, and civil society groups get together to raise income sustainably and improve their lives in a well-defined area. It’s about creating jobs, securing livelihoods, improving infrastructure and managing local resources.What do I learn?

We will be dealing with questions such as the following. Why does economic development take place in some areas of the world and not in others? Why doesn’t it happen in your place? What prevents people from having the lives they want to live right there? Could your region make more of the opportunities of globalization and new technologies? Did the promises of decentralization in your country fail to deliver better public services and more responsive governments? If these are the questions you are asking yourself, this is the right course for you. It explores the where, who and how of economic development.

Please have a look at our list of contents for the coming 8 weeks:
1.	What is LED? What drives it?
2.	How does globalization shape LED?
3.	How does decentralisation affect LED?
4.	How does competitiveness affect innovation?
5.	What are entrepreneurship and its dimensions?
6.	Why are value chains and clusters so important?
7.	What are some LED strategies?
8.	Your project

How will I learn?

In each week you will be able to access the content of the videos, suggested readings and additional videos for selective deepening. You will also find assignments that you have to complete if you want to earn a certificate for this MOOC. We will first introduce our “toolkit”, a series of theories and concepts that will help you read the situation in your locality. We will explore the main factors affecting local economic development, such as globalization, decentralisation, and competitiveness. We will discuss key components, like entrepreneurship and innovation and look into the organization of local economies into clusters, value chains and learning regions. We will conclude by deepening on some specific constructs that make local economies grow to benefit their communities. You will also contribute your ideas in the discussion forums, where you will learn from other participants around the world. 

What makes this course special? 
There is plenty of information in Internet on local economic development, which is mostly prepared by international donors or multilateral organisations. So what does this course do differently? First of all, the course is offered by academics that have significant published research on local economic development. This course gathers a wealth of academic knowledge that often fights the assumptions on what things are supposed to be like. Second, the instructors of this course have participated in dozens of capacity building projects in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Putting learning at the centre, they worked with communities, local governments, international donors and business associations. They often found a significant distance between theory and practice in local economic development, and this has been the basis of learning. Third, the course is acutely aware that each region is different and does not attempt to offer a one-size-fits-all recipe. It singles out key factors that drive local economic development and enables participants to do their own learning process, defining local problems and appropriate solutions. The aim of the course is that participants come up with their own ideas on how to promote local economic development.

How will I get a certificate?

If you want a certificate for participating in this MOOC, you will need to complete a small assignment each week and participate in the discussion forums. In the end of the MOOC, you will put these contributions together in one final document, your Capstone Project. 

I hope you find this course exciting and that you get to share our passion for promoting local economic development.

"Sleep Deprivation: Habits, Solutions, and Strategies Teach-Out",Personal Development,,"Health Technology, Productivity, Mental Health, Stress Management, Health Promotion, Community Health, Culture, Public Health, Self-Awareness, Health Care","Sleep deprivation is a silent epidemic. Since the invention of the light bulb, we have increasingly had less sleep than our ancestors. We prioritize work, school, socializing, sports, screen time – just about everything – over sleep. Sleep is viewed as compressible, something that can be made up at any time, but rarely is. Most believe this poses little risk. Unfortunately, they could not be more wrong.The truth is that an adequate amount of good-quality sleep is critical to good health. Lack of sleep leads to deadly crashes, reduces productivity, and harms quality of life. Insufficient or disordered sleep can increase risk for anxiety, depression, heart attack, stroke, arrhythmia, heart failure, and early death. This Teach-Out can be your first step in doing something about sleep deprivation.

This Teach-Out will answer:
- What are the health implications of the evolving sleep deprivation epidemic?
- Why has sleep become undervalued in society, and what cultural shifts are necessary to re-prioritize it?
- How does technology and modern lifestyle contribute to widespread sleep issues?
- What effective methods can individuals adopt to improve their sleep quality?
- How can communities and organizations facilitate better sleep habits for the general population?

Join us as we delve into the world of sleep and emerge with a new perspective on the importance of rest. You'll not only gain deeper insight into the sleep deprivation crisis but also learn how you can take tangible steps to reclaim the restorative power of sleep for yourself and others."

Organising an Empire: The Assyrian Way,Arts And Humanities,,"Ancient History, Political Sciences, Sociology, Anthropology, Social Studies, World History, Economics, Diplomacy, Governance","Discover the mighty kingdom of Assyria, which came to be the world’s first great empire three thousand years ago. From the 9th to the 7th centuries BC, during the imperial phase of Assyria’s long history, modern day northern Iraq was the central region of a state reaching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, and incorporating what is now Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as half of Israel, and wide parts of south-eastern Turkey, and Western Iran.In its geographical extent, this state was unprecedentedly large, and the distinct geography of the Middle East, with deserts and high mountain ranges, posed challenges to communication and cohesion. What were the mechanisms that kept the Empire running? This course explores the methods the Assyrian government employed to ensure unity and maintain loyalty across vast distances, using traditional as well as innovative strategies. Some of these imperial techniques have marked parallels in the ways modern multi-national corporations are operating, others will strike you as profoundly alien.

This course focusses on how the Assyrians organised their empire by analysing key aspects, namely:

· The CEO – the king, a religious, political and military leader, who is charged to govern by his master, the god Assur;

· Home Office – the royal palace in the central region and the royal court that form the administrative centre of the state;

· The Regional Managers – the governors and client-rulers to whom local power is delegated;

· Human Resources – the Empire’s people are its most precious assets, its consumers and its key product, as the goal of the imperial project was to create “Assyrians”; an approach with lasting repercussions that still reverberate in the Middle East today; and finally

· The Fruits of Empire – it takes a lot of effort, so what are the rewards?

When we explore these topics we will contextualise them with information about the lives led by ordinary Assyrian families.

Taking this course will provide you with an overview of the political, social, religious, and military history of the world’s first superpower. It will give you insight into the geography and climatic conditions of the Middle East and contribute to your understanding of the opportunities and challenges of that region. It will present you with a vision of the Middle East at a time when its political and religious structures were very different from today."

Picture yourself providing truly personalized career guidance instead of rushing through generic development plans. Envision leading strategic initiatives that transform your workplace culture rather than being buried under administrative tasks.This is the promise of AI augmentation - not replacing human judgment, but amplifying your capacity to do the work that only humans can do well.

You weren't hired to be a document processor or form filler. You were hired to understand people, solve complex human problems, and create environments where everyone can thrive. But too often, the administrative burden of HR work steals time from these higher-value activities.

This course teaches you to use AI as a force multiplier that gives you entirely new capabilities. You'll be able to analyze complex situations from multiple perspectives simultaneously, create personalized solutions at scale, and tackle challenges that would be impossible to handle manually. AI doesn't just handle your routine work - it expands what you can accomplish, letting you provide deeper insights, more comprehensive analysis, and truly customized support while still having time for the face-to-face interactions and strategic thinking that drive real organizational change.

What You'll Master:

These aren't theoretical concepts - they're practical prompting patterns that will immediately free up hours of your time every week while improving the quality of everything you produce.

The Accessible Explanation Pattern: Transform dense technical jargon into crystal-clear insights. Never again struggle to understand complex resumes, job descriptions, or technical documents. Make any expert-level content accessible to your level of understanding.

The Transformer Pattern: Take one piece of information and instantly reshape it into multiple formats. Turn performance reviews into timelines, emails, and action plans. Transform policies into clear communications for different audiences.

The Question Generator Pattern: Never walk into an interview or meeting unprepared again. Generate targeted, insightful questions that reveal exactly what you need to know about candidates, policies, or situations.

The Fusion with Citations Pattern: Combine information from multiple sources while maintaining complete traceability. Create comprehensive reports that you can confidently stand behind with proper documentation.

The Standardization Pattern: Compare apples to apples even when dealing with completely different formats. Evaluate candidates fairly by extracting and organizing their qualifications in consistent, comparable ways.

The Persona Pattern: See through other people's eyes before they even respond. Anticipate reactions, questions, and concerns from different employee groups to craft better policies and communications.

Real-World Applications That Will Amaze Your Colleagues

Performance Reviews: Fuse feedback from multiple sources into comprehensive evaluations with full citation trails. Create personalized development plans that account for individual backgrounds and company training catalogs.

Hiring Excellence: Transform incomprehensible technical resumes into  interview questions tailored to specific roles and candidates. Create standardized comparison frameworks that ensure fair evaluation.

Policy Communication: Use virtual focus groups to anticipate employee reactions before rollout. Transform complex policies into clear, stress-reducing communications for different audiences.

Document Intelligence: Extract key information from lengthy policies to answer specific questions with direct quotations and page references. Filter documents to show only relevant sections for decision-making.

Dynamic Planning: Create professional development trajectories that update automatically as employees progress. Predict resource availability and capacity based on training completion rates.


Most people use AI like a better search engine. You'll use it like having a team of expert consultants who handle all the administrative heavy lifting while you focus on what humans do best - building relationships, making nuanced decisions, and creating personalized solutions.

You'll learn not just what to ask AI, but how to structure conversations that build on themselves, creating increasingly sophisticated outputs that would take you hours to produce manually.

You'll transform from someone who processes information to someone who orchestrates intelligence, freeing yourself to spend more time on strategic thinking, one-on-one employee development, and the complex interpersonal work that drives organizational success.

Who This Course Is For:

HR professionals who want to reclaim their time for meaningful human interaction and strategic work. People who are tired of being buried under administrative tasks and want to focus on personalized employee support and organizational development. 

No technical background required. No programming needed. Just the willingness to learn patterns that will give you back hours every week to focus on the work that truly matters."
